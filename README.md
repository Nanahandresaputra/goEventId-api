## GoEventID API

This API documentation describes the GoEventID backend service, a web and mobile-based event ticket booking system. The API provides various endpoints for user authentication, event management, ticket booking, payment via Midtrans, and check-in using QR codes. Each endpoint uses a RESTful format with JWT authentication and data exchange in JSON format. This API is designed to be used by Flutter mobile applications and React.js admin dashboards to support the entire event ticket management and transaction process.
